# PearlOS

A simple bootloader and operating system for x86 machines

## The Goal
My main goal is to learn a small bit of OS DEV and how operating systems work in general.
Currently the project has a 2 stage bootloader and I am working on some very basic kernel functions

## Credits
All the resources I use a lot are 
 - OSDev.org
 - Daedalus community YT (https://www.youtube.com/@DaedalusCommunity)
 - MellOs, setup script and OS reference from mell-o-tron (https://github.com/mell-o-tron)
