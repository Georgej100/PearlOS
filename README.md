A simple bootloader and operating system for x86 machines

## The Goal
My main goal is to learn a small bit of OS DEV and how operating systems work in general.
Currently the project has a 2 stage bootloader and I am working on some very basic kernel functions
I hope to have something very basic going and mabye, get a userland

## Installation
All installation instructions can be found in the INSTALL.md file
